## Hi, I'm Caroline!
I am a computer science M1 masters student at Sorbonne University in the AI2D track, and before that graduated from Smith College with a bachelors in computer science and a mathematics minor. At Smith, I was involved in several research labs, ranging from software engineering research to mathematical modeling, and embedded systems to enhance insect monitoring. Most recently, I was a summer intern at NASA GSFC.
